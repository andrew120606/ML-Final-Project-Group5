# ML6202 - FINAL PROJECT
# Machine Learning: Detecting Brain tumors in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
# By Zongzhu Li & Maliha Aziz

The aim of this project was to apply deep learning - Artificial Neural Net approaches to a real world problem. We elected to analyse MRI scans of brain tumors with ANN methods to explore models that can be use to classify these images into tumor - non tumor classes. 
The data was obtained from

The Training set is split into the following catergories:
1. No_tumor (395)
2. Glioma_tumor (826)
3. Meningioma_tumor (822)
4. Pituitary_tumor (827)
